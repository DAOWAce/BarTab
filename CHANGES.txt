1.1 (XXX)
---------

* No longer install a custom tabbrowser binding.  This reduces code
  duplication to zero and improves compatibility with other
  extensions.  Much thanks to SHIMODA Hiroshi for the patch.

* Use the 'SSTabRestoring' event from the nsISessionStore service to
  hijack restored tabs.  This should improve compatibility with other
  extensions that use tabbrowser.addTab().  Thanks to Masahal for the
  suggestions.
