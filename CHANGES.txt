1.3.1 (2010-03-02)
------------------

* Added French translation.  Thanks to Pierre Buard.


1.3 (2010-02-28)
----------------

* Already loaded tabs can now be unloaded again ("put on the bar tab").
  One may do so manually using a context menu command.  There is also
  an optional automatic timer that will trigger after a certain amount
  of time specified by the user.

* Improved compatibility with the Tab Mix Plus extension.  Tab Mix
  Plus reuses blank tabs when opening tabs from e.g. bookmarks, and it
  confuses tabs on the bar tab with blank ones.  BarTab now makes sure
  that this no longer happens.

* New coaster logo, thanks to RÃ³man Joost.


1.2.2 (2010-02-18)
------------------

* Completed and enabled Polish translation.


1.2.1 (2010-02-18)
------------------

* To comply with Mozilla's Add-on guidelines, BarTab preferences are
  no longer available from the Firefox preference dialog.  You'll now
  find them in the extension manager.

* Added Polish translation.  Thanks to Grzglo Tech Blog.


1.2 (2010-02-14)
----------------

* Rename BarTap to BarTab.  Due to an instance of spontaneous dyslexia
  on my part, I confused 'tab' with 'tap'.  Of course I meant 'bar tab',
  not the 'tap' that beer comes out of.

* Fix faulty behaviour with about: and chrome:// URLs

* The "Reload Tab" and "Reload All Tabs" context menu items now work
  as expected.  For tabs that are on your bar tab, they will cause the
  tab contents to be loaded.  For all other tabs they will perform a
  reload as usual.

* Fix faulty behaviour when tabs are opened in the background don't
  have a referrer, e.g. when you open bookmarks in the background.

* Improve compatibility with the Split Brower add-on.

* Improve conformity with Mozilla add-on guidelines by reducing the
  usage of eval().

* Added coaster logo.


1.1 (2010-02-04)
----------------

* No longer install a custom tabbrowser binding.  This reduces code
  duplication to zero and improves compatibility with other
  extensions.  Much thanks to SHIMODA Hiroshi for the patch.

* Use the 'SSTabRestoring' event from the nsISessionStore service to
  hijack restored tabs.  This should improve compatibility with other
  extensions that use tabbrowser.addTab().  Thanks to Masahal for the
  suggestions.

* Moved preferences out of the horrible Add-on Manager UI and into
  Firefox's Tab preference pane.


1.0.1 (2010-01-31)
------------------

* Added Japanese translation.  Thanks to drry.

* Added German translation.


1.0 (2010-01-29)
----------------
