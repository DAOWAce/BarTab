1.1 (2010-02-04)
----------------

* No longer install a custom tabbrowser binding.  This reduces code
  duplication to zero and improves compatibility with other
  extensions.  Much thanks to SHIMODA Hiroshi for the patch.

* Use the 'SSTabRestoring' event from the nsISessionStore service to
  hijack restored tabs.  This should improve compatibility with other
  extensions that use tabbrowser.addTab().  Thanks to Masahal for the
  suggestions.

* Moved preferences out of the horrible Add-on Manager UI and into
  Firefox's Tab preference pane.


1.0.1 (2010-01-31)
------------------

* Added Japanese translation.  Thanks to ddry.

* Added German translation.


1.0 (2010-01-29)
