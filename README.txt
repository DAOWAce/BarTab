BarTap -- or -- Drink now, pay later: put your tabs on tap!
===========================================================

Do you keep open tabs like libraries keep books? Do you fear browser
restarts because it takes so long to reload all your tabs?

Well, fear no more! With BarTap you can put all those tabs on your tap
and only pay for the load when you actually want to visit them.

BarTap intercepts when a tab is loaded in the background (e.g. after a
browser restart) and will only load the content when the tab is
actually visited.
