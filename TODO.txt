* the first tab is never tapped

* pause icon for tapped tabs?

* context menu item on tapped tabs: load content

* suggestion from idrugoy@gmail.com: optionally allow tabs to load in
  background one by one, 20 seconds or so after restart.

* suggestion from masahal08@yahoo.co.jp: optino that will prevent your
  favourite/most used/specific tabs to be put on tap.
