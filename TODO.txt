* pause icon for tapped tabs?

* context menu item on tapped tabs: load content

* bug report from mike.rhodes@gmail.com: if a page doesn't have a
  title, I get blank tab titles--maybe fall back to URL

* suggestion from idrugoy@gmail.com: optionally allow tabs to load in
  background one by one, 20 seconds or so after restart.

* suggestion from masahal08@yahoo.co.jp, smyle: option that will
  prevent your favourite/most used/specific tabs to be put on tap.

* be able to put already loaded tabs back on tap (automatically,
  explicitly, ...)
